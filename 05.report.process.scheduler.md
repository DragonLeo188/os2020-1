# Practical Work 5: Get Scheduler Information

* Show number of context switches for process ***systemd*** using two files (two diffrent set of commands) 

    * ***proc/sched_debug***

        As what I found, /proc/sched_debug is used to show task state. On terminal there is no "proc folder", so ***crontab*** will be used instead.

        ```bash
        Daos-MacBook-Pro:~ MinhVu$ crontab -l
        crontab: no crontab for MinhVu
        ```

    * ***/proc/processId/sched***
        
        Like what is said above, ***ps -o etime= -p "$$"*** will be used

        ```bash
        Daos-MacBook-Pro:~ MinhVu$ ps -o etime= -p "405" 
        09-16:52:44
        ```

        PID 405 is id of a tab of Chrome
